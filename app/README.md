### General Info
***
In this project we will find a series of exercises and tests based on the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial?hl=es-419) tutorial.

- This image shows how we insert a message on the cell phone screen using a simple "Text" function.

- I also defined a function that admits a composable reaching the same result.

![Ejemplo](https://github.com/lis309/Application_2687340/assets/127986044/778672fd-3c56-4487-af21-a07c676539e7)

- Android Studio allows you to preview the component that I'm going to add, thus making it easier for quick visualization.
- Using the @preview annotation and defining my Message Card Preview function allows the following result.

- In this part we create a data class and pass it as objects to the Message Card function, however as is evident the components are one on top of the other because no command was given to organize them.

- Now after adding the Column function that allows to organize the elements vertically, in this case for the text components.

- Something that happens in the preview or preview is that it leaves the text overlapping due to the same reason as above I did not give it an order to organize it.

- What I did was insert an image and add a row element so it looks structured and not overlapping.

- The next thing I did was to style the image by reducing its size by cropping it in a circular way using modifiers.

- The project has some functions "ComposeTutorialTheme", "Surface" that allow you to color the theme according to the default in the functions, what I did was to bring these functions allowing you to change the colors of the application.

- Following what the image references a border to the image using one of the above functions.

- Continuing with the function change the font type for the text component.

- Simply change the theme of the application to the dark theme.

- To carry out this exercise, download a class with a default conversation from the tutorial, all I did was create a preview and a component by creating a function that would bring the conversation and display it on the screen, in an organized and harmonious way.

- In this part add an animation that allows to expand a message if it is too long

- Finally add style of a different color to the expand message animation to make it stand out.
